# Tauri v2 + Tauri Plugin SQL: SQLite Connection Examples in TypeScript & Rust

## What's this?
The official documentation explains how to connect to the database from TypeScript using a plugin, but there's no example for connecting from Rust! So, I wrote it in this repository.

- Migration: Tauri Plugin SQL
- Database Connection from TypeScript: Tauri Plugin SQL (This uses sqlx internally.)
- Database Connection from Rust: sqlx
